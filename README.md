<!-- Project Description -->
## 📝 Project Description

This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing projects focused on **Time Series Analysis** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The projects demonstrate proficiency in handling time-dependent data, identifying patterns, and performing statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights.

The main goal is to apply Python's robust data science ecosystem to solve real-world problems across different domains, such as climate, sales, and energy consumption.

<!-- Project Status -->
## 🚀 Project Status

The portfolio is **Expanding**. New time series models, data analysis techniques, and case studies are added regularly to enhance the collection.

<!-- Features and Application Demonstration -->
## ✨ Features and Application Demonstration

The repository consists of Jupyter Notebooks, each detailing a specific analysis project. The table below summarizes the focus, objectives, and key findings of each project:

| Project | Primary Focus | Key Objectives | Demonstration (Notebook) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Climate Time Series Analysis** | Analysis of daily climate data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure) for New Delhi. | Identify seasonality, perform data cleaning, and visualize the time-dependent behavior of climate variables. | [`ClimateTimeSeriesAnalysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/lucaspn017/time_series_analysis/blob/main/ClimateTimeSeriesAnalysis.ipynb) |
| **Sales Data Inspection** | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on a Superstore sales dataset. | Analyze sales distribution by region and category, and apply clustering (K-Means) to identify customer segments. | [`Inpeção_dados_de_vendas.ipynb`](https://github.com/lucaspn017/time_series_analysis/blob/main/Inpe%C3%A7%C3%A3o_dados_de_vendas.ipynb) |
| **Energy Consumption Analysis** | Time series analysis of energy consumption data, focusing on peak and off-peak hours. | Separate consumption values into peak and off-peak periods and calculate excess reactive energy. | [`Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/lucaspn017/time_series_analysis/blob/main/Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb) |

**Demonstration:** To view the analyses, simply click on the notebook links above. GitHub renders the full content, including code and visualizations, directly in the browser.
